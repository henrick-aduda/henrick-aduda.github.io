Summary: Finding love within yourself

My love

what happened to you 

nowadays I dont feel your arms wrapped around my heart

My love 

what happened to you 

please come back to me

I am aching for your healing hands



My love

I beg you my love

Please come back to me

These days my heart is so broke

My body feels like a loosing battle

My spirit is fleeting like the wind

My love please come back to me

I speak to you my love

Please come back to me



My love

what happened to you

I dont feel your tears running down my cheeks anymore

please come back to me

I want you to still love me when am gone

I want you to love me when my memories fade

I want you to love me while I still love you



My love I know you are hurting

I know the darkness clenches your light

I know laughter feels like a dream

I know you forgot how it feels like to run against the wind

My love 

Please come back to me.



My love 

I will always be here for you

I shall love you even when you forget to love yourself

I shall love you forever my love

Yours sincerely,

Yourself.
