## Henrick 

I am a Bionformatics Postgraduate student at Pwani University, Kenya. I am  based in Entebbe, Uganda where I am taking my Research 
project at Uganda Virus Research Institute. I am a passionate altruist, a poet ,spiritual ethusiast, avid reader,art lover , 
a budding gym ethusiast , a nerd , a lover of nature , an intellect and most importantly I am Human. I enjoy cooking, I treasure 
deep vulnerable conversations spanning various topics , I find pleasure in solitude (INTROVERT ALERT!!), I love writing and travelling. My personality type according to the Myers Briggs Test is INFJ-T which stands for Introversion (I) , Intuition (N),
Feeling (F) and Judgment (J). The T at the end stands for Turbulent. Turbulent INFJs are often fueled by their worries and concerns
, a quality that enables INFJ-T to make significant progress in society. I guess this is both a super power and a disadvantage to
myself at times. Famous INFJs include Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, Mother Teresa and Marie Kondo. All these phenomenal 
individuals exude character traits that I possess . I strive to live a life of excellence ; one that is of the greatest service to
others. This poetry blog is the cornerstone towards the building of my dreams . My hope is that through the words I sculpt healing
may be possible for you , that you may find peace, gratitude, love and compassion for yourself and for other human beings around 
you. My dream is that you may be inspired to be the greatest version of yourself you can be.


My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some
style - Maya Angelou.
