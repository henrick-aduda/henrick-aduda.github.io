| My love
| what happened to you
| nowadays I dont feel your arms wrapped around my heart
| My love,what happened to you
| please come back to me
| I am aching for your healing hands	
|
| Please come back to me
| These days my heart is so broke
| My body feels like a loosing battle
| My spirit is fleeting like the wind
| Please come back to me
|
| I dont feel your tears running down my cheeks anymore
| I want you to love me while the moon still dances for the sun
| I want you to love me while the ocean still hugs the shores
| I want you to love me while I still love you

| I know you are hurting
| I know the darkness clenches your light
| I know laughter feels like a dream
| I know you forgot how it feels like to run against the wind
| My love 
| Please come back to me.
|
| My love 
| I will always be here for you
| I shall love you even when you forget to love yourself
| I shall love you forever my love
| Yours sincerely,
| Yourself.

i LOVE BEING HERE
