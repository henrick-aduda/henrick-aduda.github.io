## Henrick 

I am a Bionformatics Postgraduate student at Pwani University, Kenya. I am currently based in Entebbe, Uganda where I am taking my Research project at Uganda Virus Research Institute. I am a poet,spiritual ethusiast, avid reader, art lover,budding gym ethusiast,a nerd, a lover of nature, an intellect and most importantly I am Human. I enjoy cooking, I enjoy deep vulnerable conversations spanning various topics , I find pleasure in solitude (INTROVERT ALERT!!), I love writing, I love travelling and I am a passionate altruist. My personality type according to the Myers Briggs Test is INFJ-T which basically stands for Introversion (I) , Intuition (N), Feeling (F) and Judgment (J). The T at the end stands for Turbulent. Turbulent INFJs are often fueled by their worries and concerns, a quality that enables INFJ-T to make significant progress in society. I guess this is both a super power and a disadvantage to myself at times. Famous INFJs include Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, Mother Teresa and Marie Kondo. All these phenomenal individuals exude character traits that I endeavour to align with. I strive to live a life of excellence and one that is of the greatest service to others. This poetry blog is a cornerstone towards the realization of that dream. I hope that through the words that i carve out that you may find healing, that you may find peace, gratitude, love and compassion for yourself and for other human beings. 


My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style - Maya Angelou
